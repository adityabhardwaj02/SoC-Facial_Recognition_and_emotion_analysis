# Facial Recognition and Emotion Analysis in Video Streams

The project heavily relies on python and its libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and open cv. So we had to watch the tutorials for all these libraries for the first 1 and a half week to get a jist of which functions we're going to use.


Mentors also shared a pdf of how facial recognition and emotion analysis is done in the video streams which was quite useful
Some tutorials of Deep learning and neural networks were also shared for the week 2 and above and we had to learn the mathematics behind it.  

Later we got an assignment of recognising digits from the MNIST data set using CNN which is due on 28th. I've tried to implement this using basic neural networks using 2 layers. I'll implement it using CNN later this week.I'm currently working on deep neural networks and ill upload a code on the working of the same after some hours.


I've added the respective .ipynb files in this repo and the training and testing datasets as well so you can run this code in your computers and check the accuracy as well.
