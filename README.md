# SoC-Facial_Recognition_and_emotion_analysis
The project heavily relies on python and its libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and open cv. So we had to watch the tutorials for all these libraries for the first 1 and a half week to get a jist of which functions we're going to use
Mentors also shared a pdf of how facial recognition and emotion analysis is done in the video streams which was quite useful
Some tutorials of Deep learning and neural networks were also shared for the week 2 and above and we had to learn the mathematics behind it 
Later we got an assignment of recognising digits from the MNIST data set using CNN which is due on 28th. I've tried to implement this using basic neural networks using 1 layer and later with deep neural networks using multiple layers. I'll implement it using CNN later this week.
I've added the respective .ipynb files in this repo and the MNIST dataset as well
